# Assignment 1: Personal Finance Manager

###  Objective

Create a **command-line program** in Python to manage **Accounts**, **Transactions**, and **Budgets**.
The system must support **CRUD operations**, **CSV persistence**, **exception handling**, and **object-oriented design**.

---

## Learning Goals

By completing this project, you will:

* Apply **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.
* Practice **data persistence** using CSV files.
* Implement **error handling** with custom and built-in exception classes.
* Develop a **menu-driven command-line interface (CLI)**.
* Use **modular code organization** and **virtual environments**.
* Write and run **basic automated tests** using `pytest`.

---

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features

1. Manage **Accounts** (wallets, banks, or savings).
2. Manage **Transactions** (each purchase or income).
3. Manage **Budgets** (monthly spending plans).
4. Support **CRUD operations** for each.
5. **Save** and **Load** data from **CSV files**.
6. Handle **errors** (e.g. invalid input, file errors, duplicates).
7. Use **subclasses** (e.g. `BankAccount`, `CashAccount`).
8. Provide a **menu-driven CLI** for user interaction.

---

## Testing Requirement

Include **at least 3–5 test cases in total**, covering **unit, integration, and system testing aspects** using the `pytest` module.
> example: at least one test for individual methods (unit), one for interactions between classes (integration), and one that tests the main workflow (system).

---

##  Setup Instructions

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (if any)
pip install pytest
```

Generate a `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

**At submission, ensure that:**

* Your project runs correctly when the virtual environment is activated.
* `requirements.txt` lists all necessary packages.

---

## Deliverables

Submit a `.zip` folder containing:

1. All **Python source files**
2. Example **CSV files** generated by the app
3. `tests/` folder with your test cases
4. `README.md` including:

   * Project overview
   * Installation & running instructions
   * Example usage
   * Testing instructions
5. `requirements.txt` file

## Data Model

| Entity          | Required Fields                                                 |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Account**     | `ID`, `name`, `type`, `currency`                                |
| **Transaction** | `ID`, `account_id`, `date`, `amount`, `description`, `category` |
| **Budget**      | `ID`, `month`, `category`, `limit_amount`                       |

## Design Requirements

### Modularity

Organize your project into folders:

```
personal_finance/
├── main.py
├── models/
│   ├── account.py
│   ├── transaction.py
│   └── budget.py
├── managers/
│   ├── account_manager.py
│   ├── transaction_manager.py
│   └── budget_manager.py
├── storage/
│   └── csv_storage.py
├── tests/
│   └── test_finance.py
└── exceptions.py
```

### OOP and Subclasses

* Implement **base classes** (`Account`, `Transaction`, `Budget`).
* Add **specialized subclasses**, for example:

  * `CashAccount`, `BankAccount`
  * `ExpenseTransaction`, `IncomeTransaction`

---

### Exception Handling

Use **custom exceptions** to manage validation and file errors:

```python
class FinanceError(Exception): pass
class ValidationError(FinanceError): pass
class NotFoundError(FinanceError): pass
class StorageError(FinanceError): pass
```

---

## Input/Output and CSV Storage

Each manager should be able to:

* Export its data to a CSV file.
* Load data from CSV on demand.

**Example `accounts.csv`:**

```
id,name,account_type,currency
A1,Wallet,cash,HUF
A2,Bank,bank,EUR
```

---

## Example CLI Menu

```
1. Manage Accounts
2. Manage Transactions
3. Manage Budgets
4. Save to CSV
5. Load from CSV
6. Exit
```

Each submenu should include CRUD operations (List, Create, Update, Delete).

---

## Project Planning

- You are free to design and plan your solution in your own way.
- The folder structure and examples above are provided as guidance, not strict requirements.
- Focus on creating a clear, reusable, and well-organized project structure that best fits your design.



## Oral Defence (25 points)

After submitting your project, you will **orally present your work** to the instructor.
During the defence, you should:

* **Briefly explain** your project’s structure and main features.
* **Demonstrate** how your program runs (e.g., CLI navigation, CRUD operations, CSV saving/loading).
* **Write code live** based on the instructor’s questions.
  For example, the teacher may ask you to:

  * Define the `Account` model
  * Implement a `create()` function
  * Show how data is saved to or loaded from a CSV file

Your **oral defence score (25 points)** will be based on:

1. Clarity of your explanation
2. Correctness and completeness of your live coding
3. Understanding of your own project design and functionality

**Final Notes**

* Make sure your code runs without errors.
* Use **meaningful class and function names**.
* Ensure your tests pass before submission.
* The Oral Defence will take place during your lab session on November 24th or 26th, depending on your group schedule.
